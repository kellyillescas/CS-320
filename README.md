To ensure code, a program, or software is functional, I (and any team I am on) must test early and often. This is vital because there are many costly
mistakes that can occur when a product is not tested. This can happen when a program is created in full, then tested at the end, or when integration is
performed and the resulting errors are not caught in time because the project lacked integration testing. For security purposes, it is vital that I secure
it from the start. I must utilize secure features such as access control, establishing identity, and protecting data and privacy. 

To interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program, I must communicate with the users, either individually or as a whole. I can create
questionnaires for users to fill out, conduct meetings, speak with the users, or even engage users in a beta testing-type scenario. This way, I know that
my program will be successful because it is what the user wants.

To approach designing software, the users’ needs must come first. As stated above, I need to do whatever possible to gather requirements and interpret the
users’ desires. I can then begin designing my software and incorporating my ideas into the program design. As I begin writing code I must also begin
testing to be sure that my code works from the start and that I eliminate any bugs I could miss if I wait too long. As this process is occurring, I will
begin to get feedback from users/stakeholders to be sure that I am continuing on the right track with the development process. As a program slowly becomes
a finished product, I will once again consult with any stakeholders and be sure the product is what is desired. I will then begin a final testing stage
that uses both testers on my end, as well as end-user testing. When a program is deemed complete and is ready to launch, I know that my job is not
complete. I must continually update and test the program as user needs and scalability change.
